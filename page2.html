            <p>
                Melika, every game has its ups and downs, but with you by my side, I know we can make it to the next level together. ðŸ’•
                <br>
                Iâ€™m asking you not just to play games with me, but to join me in every adventure life throws at us. 
                I promise to cherish and spoil you, to laugh with you through wins and losses, and to always be there with my heart on 'co-op mode'. ðŸŽ®ðŸ’–
                <br><br>
                So... will you be my girlfriend and embark on this amazing journey with me?
            </p>
